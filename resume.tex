%Project 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\combosection{3D Printer Mods and Improvements}{Marlin Firmware, CAD Design}{July 2019 - Present}{}
\smallskip
    \begin{tightlist}
        \item Designed and implemented a case for an SKR 1.4 mainboard and an LCD screen. The case is made to be detached from the printer but still wired by a tether connected to the printer via DIN terminals.
        \item Implemented a direct drive extruder with an attached BLTouch bed leveling sensor along with a custom designed fan shroud for it.
        \item Upgraded to dual Z motors in order to fix X gantry sag due to the heavier extruder assembly.
\end{tightlist}

\combosection{Tethered Underwater ROV}{CAD Design, Python, 3D Printing}{February - April 2019}{}
\vspace{\topsep}
    \begin{tightlist}
        \item Worked as part of a two man team in order to develop a final project for an engineering class in High School.
        \item The ROV consisted of three brushless thrusters in order to control direction and altitude.
        \item Contained within the robot is a 4 axis motion controlled gimbal with an attached camera and a live feed streamed back to the operator on the surface.
        \item The tethering was completed using a waterproof armored ethernet cable using simple internet communications protocols between the raspberry pi on the ROV and the surface all programmed using Python.
\end{tightlist}

%Project 3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\combosection{200 LED Sign}{Soldering, Electronics, C++}{January 2018}{}
\vspace{\topsep}
    \begin{tightlist}
        \item Designed a 200 LED sign using off the shelf 3mm LED's, Perfboard, two 9 volt batteries, Maxim 7219 IC's, and an ATiny 85 microprocessor.
        \item The sign was constructed using three large perfboard pieces with the led's spelling the name of my high school engineering teacher.
        \item Each board was connected using a DIY pin header connector which transferred power and data to the LED drivers. This was all driven with an ATtiny 85 microprocessor running C++ arduino code.
    \end{tightlist}
